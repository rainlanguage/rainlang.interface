    /// analysis) calculate the memory required to be allocated for the stack in
    /// total, and that no out of bounds memory reads/writes occur within this
    /// stack. A simple example of an invalid source would be one that pushes one
    /// value to the stack then attempts to pops two values, clearly we cannot
    /// remove more values than we added. The `IExpressionDeployerV4` MUST revert
    /// in the case of any integrity failure, all integrity checks MUST pass in
    /// order for the deployment to complete.
    ///
    /// Once the integrity check is complete the `IExpressionDeployerV4` MUST do
    /// any additional processing required by its paired interpreter.

    /// opcodes in the `ExpressionConfig` sources with real function pointers
    /// from the corresponding interpreter.

    /// integrity checks. It is assumed that the bytecode will be produced from
    /// a human friendly string via. `IParserV1.parse` but this is not required
    /// if the caller has some other means to prooduce valid bytecode.
