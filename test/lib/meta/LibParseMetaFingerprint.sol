/// two words map to the same expansion bit AND carry the same 3 byte
/// fingerprint under one of the seeds it picks. The two words are then
/// indistinguishable in the 4 byte meta item, so the meta cannot represent both
/// and generation has to fail. That is a documented and intended outcome of a
/// 1 byte bitmap plus 3 byte fingerprint address space, which gives the same
/// collision resistance as a solidity selector. A real word set that hits it is
/// fixed by renaming a word, not by changing the library.
///
/// A fuzzer drawing uniformly random `bytes32` words draws that ~2^-32 per pair
/// coincidence often enough to flake CI, so fuzz tests that build a parse meta
/// from a fuzzed word set must exclude such sets up front rather than assert
/// that generation succeeds for them.
